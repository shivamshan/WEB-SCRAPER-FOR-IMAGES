# WEB-SCRAPER-FOR-IMAGES
Most of the time when we need to perform an image classification task, we face the shortage of images.
</br>
</br>
Therefore i worked on this web scraping code to automatically fetch images from google images.
</br>
</br>
All you need to provide is a keyword, i.e. the word describing the type of pictures you want to download.
</br>
</br>
In the code provided above the word **dog** is the keyword.
</br>
</br>
Also the code is written as such that it downloads all the images displayed on a single page.
</br>
Feel free to tweak the code as per your necessity.
</br>
</br>
## The code is written using selenium and pyhton, so install both of these beforehand.
THANK YOU.
